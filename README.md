# Bender

A solution to https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/bender-episode-1 from CodinGame, along with a simple terminal visualization of the game. A simple but non-trivial example of using pattern matching and the IO and State monads in Haskell.

## Overview

Bender begins at the starting point `@` of the map and seeks for the suicide booth `$`, where he explodes. His course is completely deterministic and is defined by the different map symbols who change his direction or behavior. For a full description check https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/bender-episode-1.

In the beginning you are asked to pick one of the given maps (write the number and press `enter`). When selected, you can start with `enter` and then navigate the history of Bender's moves by `k` and `l`. `k` takes you one step to the past and `l` one step to the future. Have fun! (Warning! If you haven't tried to solve the puzzle you might find this very boring!)  

## Setup

Simply run the 'Bender-exe' file.

## Known issues

To exit the application one needs to break the process, i.e. press `ctrl + C`. In order to try a different map one needs to restart the application.

## Implementation

There are actually two data structures that keep the information of the game: `Bender` and the `CityMap`. The state is a stack of tuples `(Bender, CityMap)`. A new configuration is pushed when moving to the future and the last configuration pops when going back to the past. Those are controlled respectively by the `update` and `undo` instances of the State monad. There is a third instance, `doNothing`, which just preserves the current state. All those elements live in `src/Lib.hs`. One could separate them in files, but they were deliberately put together in order to keep this an (almost) one page app.

`singleStep` is a transformed state monad which wraps an IO monad. This means it accesses directly functions that update the state plus it can use IO actions by using the `lift` function. It does the following:

1. Reads the user's key input
2. Maps the input to actions: `'l' -> undo, 'k' -> update, everything else -> doNothing`
3. Applies the action to the input state
4. Prints the map of the updated state
5. Returns the updated state

`singleAction` is composed with itself infinitely many times in `mainLoop` and produces the main loop of the application. All this happens in `app/Main.hs`.
